    <oval-def:description>It was discovered that Java did not correctly handle untrusted applets. If a user were tricked into running a malicious applet, a remote attacker could gain user privileges, or list directory contents. It was discovered that Kerberos authentication and RSA public key processing were not correctly handled in Java. A remote attacker could exploit these flaws to cause a denial of service. It was discovered that Java accepted UTF-8 encodings that might be handled incorrectly by certain applications. A remote attacker could bypass string filters, possible leading to other exploits. Overflows were discovered in Java JAR processing. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a malicious JAR file, a remote attacker could crash the application, leading to a denial of service. It was discovered that Java calendar objects were not unserialized safely. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a specially crafted calendar object, a remote attacker could execute arbitrary code with user privileges. It was discovered that the Java image handling code could lead to memory corruption. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a specially crafted image, a remote attacker could crash the application, leading to a denial of service. It was discovered that temporary files created by Java had predictable names. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a specially crafted JAR file, a remote attacker could overwrite sensitive information</oval-def:description>
